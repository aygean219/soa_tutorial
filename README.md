# Securing REST APIs

## Overview
REST APIs allow different systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. Since these APIs handle data exchange, securing them is essential to prevent unauthorized access.

## Securing REST APIs
To protect APIs, we implement:

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the client.
- **Authorization**: Ensures the client has permission to perform an action.

### Using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
A common method for securing APIs is **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**. JWTs are digitally signed JSON objects used for:

- **Authentication**: A client logs in and receives a token.
- **Authorization**: The client includes the token with each request for verification.

By implementing JWT-based security, APIs can efficiently manage access and ensure that only authorized users interact with protected resources.
